# IDEO Data Exercise

I went through the interview process with IDEO and the attached notebook is the take home exercise they asked me to complete. I thought this was a fun exercise and allowed me to showcase some of my creativity and problem-solving abilities, so I have attached it to my portfolio. While it dod not work out with IDEO, I am thankful for the opportunity and the learning experience.
