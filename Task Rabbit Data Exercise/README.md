# TaskRabbit Data Exercise

TaskRabbit put out a Data Exercise for one of their positions and I thought it was a good exercise to showcase some of my problem-solving and python skills. I ended up making it to the final round of interviews before the hiring manager reached out, saying that they are pushing off the hiring for this position for another 6-9 months. In any case, this was a fun data project and wanted to show it off on my portfolio.
