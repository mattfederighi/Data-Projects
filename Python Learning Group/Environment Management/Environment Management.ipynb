    "Issues may arise when using pip and conda together. Most of these issues stem from that fact that conda, like other package managers, has limited abilities to control packages it did not install. Running conda after pip has the potential to overwrite and potentially break packages installed via pip. Similarly, pip may upgrade or remove a package which a conda-installed package requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining conda and pip, it is best to use an isolated conda environment. Only after conda has been used to install as many packages as possible should pip be used to install any remaining software. If modifications are needed to the environment, it is best to create a new environment rather than running conda after pip. When appropriate, conda and pip requirements should be stored in text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "<li> Use pip after conda\n",
    "<li> Use conda environments for isolation \n",
    "<li> Recreate the environment if changes are needed    \n",
    "<li> Store conda and pip requirements in text files   "
