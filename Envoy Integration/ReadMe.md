# Envoy Integration
To track location visits, we used an app called Envoy. This app allowed people to check-in and out of location, as well as send and receive invitations to go to locations. 

### The Problem
We needed a way to track who was visiting locations, as well as a few other key HR metrics to ensure location safety.

### The Solution
Since reporting in Envoy wouldn't get us the fill picture, we decided to connect to this API via python-requests and then join this data with other pertinent visotor information. This would allow us to get a complete view into location visits as well as location safety.
