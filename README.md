# Matt Federighi's Portfolio

I’ve spent a lot of time in nature climbing walls, hiking mountains and sleeping under the stars deep in the backcountry. Adventure, Exploration, and Storytelling have always been major aspects of my life, which is why I’ve now found myself trekking around in the vast world of Data Science. 

When I tell people that I’m in the world of Data Science, most of them give me a blank stare and tell me that they couldn’t do that because they were never good at math. To me, data is much more than numbers and math. It’s an adventure where you get to explore large quantities of data, uncovering hidden insights and transforming that information into a story that everyone can understand. 

## About this Portfolio

Above you will find a list of folders with a sample of projects I have worked on (both professionally and academically). In each folder you will find a README.md file that will explain the project at a high level as well as why I chose to do that project. You will also find a Jupyter notebook / Tableau Workbook that shows my methodology and visualizations for the project. Datasets are not uploaded here, but feel free to reach out if you would like access to any data. 

Note that I am constantly adding new projects to this portfolio and I am often updating existing projects if I learn new techniques and want to apply them to datasets I am familiar with. If you have any questions about projects or if you want to know why I chose a particular method over another, please don't hesitate to reach out!
