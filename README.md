# Matt Federighi's Portfolio

I’ve spent a lot of time in nature climbing walls, hiking mountains and sleeping under the stars deep in the backcountry. Adventure, Exploration, and Storytelling have always been major aspects of my life, which is why I’ve now found myself trekking around in the vast world of Data Science. 

When I tell people that I’m in the world of Data Science, most of them give me a blank stare and tell me that they couldn’t do that because they were never good at math. To me, data is much more than numbers and math. It’s an adventure where you get to explore large quantities of data, uncovering hidden insights and transforming that information into a story that everyone can understand. 

## About this Portfolio

Note that I am constantly adding new projects to this portfolio and I am often updating existing projects if I learn new techniques and want to apply them to datasets I am familiar with. If you have any questions about projects or if you want to know why I chose a particular method over another, please don't hesitate to reach out!
