# FordGo Bikeshare Data

The Jupyter Notebook attached contains an EDA of the FordGo Bikeshare data from June 2017 to November 2018. [Here is a link to the dataset.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html) 

## Why Am I Doing This? 

In early July 2018, Lyft acquired Motivate, the largest bikeshare operator in North America. Motivate operates many of the largest bikeshare systems in North America, including Citi Bike (New York), Ford GoBike (San Francisco Bay area), Divvy (Chicago), Blue Bikes (Boston metro area), Capital Bikeshare (Washington, D.C. metro area), BIKETOWN (Portland metro area), CoGo (Columbus, Ohio), and Nice Ride (Minneapolis). In 2017, 80 percent of the bikeshare trips in the United States were on Motivate-operated systems.

Since Ford GoBike is located in the San Francisco Bay Area (including Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose), I was particularly interested in the details around Ford GoBikes. There are a few stations right around my house and wanted to explore the data to get a better understanding of the service. 

In the Jupyter Notebook attached, I have conducted an EDA with the Ford GoBike data which shows some general trends, demographic information on riders, and gives us a better understanding of how Ford GoBikes operate around the San Francisco Bay Area. 

In future analysis, I will bring in data from WeatherUnderground and attempt tp predict ridership based on the weather.
