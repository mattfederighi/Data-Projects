# Instacart Market Baset Analysis

In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. They’re not only looking for the best model, Instacart’s also looking for machine learning engineers to grow their team.

## Why Am I Doing This? 
When browsing through Kaggle, I found an old competition that was a Market Baset Analysis for Instacart. I am not an Instacart user, but I was extremely curious about this dataset. So, I conducted an EDA on the dataset to get a better understanding of the products Instacart offers and gather insights on user behavior. In the Jupyter notebook attached, you will find an EDA that does just that. 

There is another part of this project which attempts to predict which products users will purchase. I will upload this file at a later time.
